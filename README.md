**Key terms**

    **pip**  is the preferred installer program. Starting with Python 3.4, it is included by default with the Python binary installers.

    A virtual environment is a semi-isolated Python environment that allows packages to be installed for use by a particular application, rather than being installed system wide.

    venv is the standard tool for creating virtual environments, and has been part of Python since Python 3.3. Starting with Python 3.4, it defaults to installing pip into all created virtual environments.
